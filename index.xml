      <description>What changed?  All file names that are created new now have _ where special characters should be, but the title remains the same You have now the ability to select more repositories to publish to. Previously you had the ability to select the first 30, now it&amp;rsquo;s the first 100. More will follow later (We&amp;rsquo;re thinking infinite)  That&amp;rsquo;s it for today, not much, but important for our users.</description>

Aesthetic Changes  Removed datepicker from login forn - all we wanted is to make sure that the people registering are not underage for the internet Red Warning text on download page, not so scary anymore - we listened to feedback and the text on the download page was scary, because it was red and big enough to intimidate.</description>
